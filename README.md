# BoxScore

A Ruby on Rails web application used to create and build box scores for basketball.

## User Stories

1. As a **User**, I want to sign up for a free account by providing a user name, password and email.
2. As a **User**, I want to sign in and out of **boxscore**.
3. As a **User**, I want to have a profile page.
4. As a **User**, I want to be able to create and track one or more basketball **teams**.
5. For each **Team**, a **user** wants to add and save one or more **players** by name, height, and position.
6. For each **game**, a **user** can enter in basic basketball statistics (minutes, points, rebounds, assists, etc.). More advanced statistics (true shooting percentage, per 100 possessions, etc.) will be calculated automatically.
7. After each **game**, the **team's** and each **player's** statistics are saved and aggregated.
