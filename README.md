1. As a **User**, I want to sign up for a free account by providing a user name, password and email.
2. As a **User**, I want to sign in and out of **boxScore**.
3. As a **User**, I want to have a **Profile** page.
4. As a **User**, I want to be able to create and track one or more basketball **Teams**.
5. For each **Team**, a **User** wants to add and save one or more **Players** by name, height, position, number, height, and weight.
6. For each **Game**, a **User** can enter in basic basketball statistics (minutes, points, rebounds, assists, etc.). More advanced statistics (true shooting percentage, per 100 possessions, etc.) will be calculated automatically.
